# **moonquake_map_2.0**
A moonquake map is important for analyzing moonquake trends on the moon for safer future lunar missions. On the map, we can easily identify the risk zones on the moon. We can also enhance public engagement and understanding of lunar science and moonquakes by making historic seismic data accessible and engaging.

## Why is it important?
There is no proper web app for the public to study the moonquakes effectively. There is a huge amount of seismic data collected by Nasa. But studying these data is really hard because of the lack of easy software or web apps. Also, there is no app with full visualization features, and accessing this data is not easy for the public, which creates a lack of public engagement.

The first moonquake map was created in the 1970s using data from seismometers that were placed on the moon by Apollo astronauts. Since then, scientists have collected more data from seismometers on the Moon and from orbiters that have passed by the Moon. The Moon is a very quiet place, and the seismic waves from moonquakes are very weak. This makes it difficult to detect and locate moonquakes. However, scientists are constantly improving their techniques for detecting and mapping moonquakes. After studying these data, we have developed our web app.

## How does it work?
Our web-app is specially designed for the public to visualize the earthquake data on an interactive 3D globe. For the first time, we have created the moonquake simulation using three.js. With a user-friendly interface, our app provides an intuitive experience. Swipe through various features and explore the earthquake data effortlessly.
Educating the masses is at the heart of our project. Our 'Learn' section offers a wealth of knowledge about moonquakes. Images with description, videos about moon, we make learning about the moon and lunar seismology engaging and accessible. For our project, we are using Nasa’s data and Nasa’s API. Our web-app has a lot of options for exploring moonquake data. We can plot the moonquakes on the interactive 3D globe. We can also watch a clear 3D view of the moon's surface. From our data visualization, we can detect risky moonquake zones. We can also visualize the depth of the moonquakes. Our project is an open-source project and will be available on GitHub. Our web app will support different types of devices, like laptops and smartphones. With our app, the public can access knowledge and information about the moon like never before. In future, we want to make VR experiences like moonquake experiences, walking on the moon for the kids, so that people can learn lunar science more effectively.
